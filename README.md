# ML-model-1
This was my first ML model. I loaded the data from the data professors Delaney solubility dataset. Then the data was prepared by separating it as X and Y. Then the data was split. Then we built two models, the first one using Linear Regression and the second one using Random Forest Both these models were trained, then applied to make a prediction and then we evaluated model performance. In the last step, we compared both models and did a data visualization of the prediction results
