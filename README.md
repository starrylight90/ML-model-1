# ML-model-1
This was my first ML model. I loaded the data from the data professors delaney soulbility dataset.
Then the data was prepared by separating it as X and Y. Then the data was split.
Then we built two models, first one using Linear Regression and second one using Random Forest
Both these models were trained, then were applied to make a prediction and then we evaluated model performance.
In the last step we compared both the models and did a data visualization of the prediction results
